# Soccer Player Analysis Project

## Research Question
What player attributes (speed, height, passing ability, ball control, etc.) are most closely correlated to a player’s overall rating? This project aims to understand the correlations between players’ abilities and their overall rating to guide strategic decision-making for the soccer organization.

## Project Highlights
- Utilizes the Pearson correlation test for statistical significance evaluation.
- Employs visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, and regression plots.
- Criteria for success include statistical evidence, concise visualizations, and a detailed report (video presentation).

## Project Objectives and Deliverables
1. **Objective:** Import and cleanse the dataset.
   - **Deliverable 1.1:** A clean dataset for analysis and future use.

2. **Objective:** Analyze the dataset for attribute correlations.
   - **Deliverable 2.1:** Jupyter notebook detailing analysis process, statistical tests, and hypothesis outcomes.

3. **Objective:** Create easily understood visualizations.
   - **Deliverable 3.1:** Heatmaps, bar charts, and regression plots illustrating attribute correlations.

## Usage
