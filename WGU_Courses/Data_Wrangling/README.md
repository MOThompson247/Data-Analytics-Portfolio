# Data Wrangling

In the "Introduction to Data Wrangling" course, I undertook various tasks, including gathering, assessing, cleaning, storing, analyzing, visualizing data, and reporting. Specifically, I wrangled data from the popular X (Twitter) account 'WeRateDogs.' The project involved identifying and documenting a minimum of 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues within the dataset, utilizing both visual and programmatic assessments. The resulting insights from the cleaned dataset encompassed information on top dog breeds, highest average ratings, and correlations between retweets, favorites, and ratings.

I employed Python for coding within Jupyter Notebooks. The primary coding file is in the .ipynb format, while the other two files comprise written reports.
