During the **Practical Statistics** course, I applied Python programming within Jupyter Notebooks. The project centered around comprehending the outcomes of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website. The task involved analyzing a new webpage designed by the company to potentially enhance user conversions, indicating users who decide to purchase the company's product. The objective was to navigate through the notebook and assist the company in determining whether to implement the new page, retain the old page, or prolong the experiment for a more informed decision. Throughout the project, I honed my coding skills in various statistical analyses, including probability, sampling distribution, z-scores, null hypothesis testing, and logistic regression.
